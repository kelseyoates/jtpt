“In the several months that I've been training with Jay, I have learned to eat better, exercise more intelligently, and most importantly stay motivated. Getting fit is more enjoyable than ever, and I'm seeing the best results I've ever had when working out.

"Check out these accomplishments: I've dropped from a 42" waist to a 38" waist size I've dropped from a XXL shirt size to an XL shirt size I had to buy a smaller belt I'm getting more compliments and positive feedback on my appearance than I have in years Much higher self-esteem and confidence.

"It's taken a lot of hard work and commitment to get to this point, and I have more to go. But I've never been happier with my appearance or level of fitness!.”
